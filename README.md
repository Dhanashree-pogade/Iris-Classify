# Iris Classify

Iris Insight is a machine learning project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project involves data preprocessing, training a classifier, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the distribution of features in the dataset.

## Project Structure

```
Iris Insight
│
├── iris_test.csv          # Dataset file
├── iris_insight.py        # Main Python script for the project
├── README.md              # This README file
└── requirements.txt       # List of dependencies
```

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Dataset**: Load the Iris dataset from the CSV file.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Separate features and target variable.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Standardize the features.

3. **Train the Model**: Use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to train the model.

4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

5. **Evaluate the Model**: Calculate the accuracy of the model.

6. **Visualize Data**: Plot histograms to visualize the distribution of each feature.

### Running the Project

To run the project, execute the `iris_insight.py` script. This will load the dataset, train the model, evaluate its performance, and plot the histograms.

```bash
python iris_insight.py
```

### Example Output

```
   sepal.length  sepal.width  petal.length  petal.width variety
0           5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2  Setosa
1           4.9          3.0           1.4          0.2  Setosa
2           4.7          3.2           1.3          0.2  Setosa
3           4.6          3.1           1.5          0.2  Setosa
4           5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2  Setosa

Accuracy: 100.00%
```

## Visualizations

### `iris_insight.py`

Here's the main Python script `iris_insight.py` to include in your project:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
data_path = 'iris_test.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure
print(data.head())

# Convert the target labels to numerical values
data['variety'] = data['variety'].astype('category').cat.codes

# Separate features and target variable
X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = data.iloc[:, -1].values

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create and train the KNN classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

# Plot histograms for each feature in the dataset
features = data.columns[:-1]  # All columns except the last one
data_features = data.iloc[:, :-1]

# Set the aesthetic style of the plots
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Plot each feature
for feature in features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(data_features[feature], kde=True)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.xlabel(feature)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.show()
```
